Abstractâ€”This project involves building a multi-cycle CPU implementation built on the SIK assembly language. This includes determining an encoding for each instruction, creating the actual processor and slowed memory along with a variable-sized cache for quicker instruction and data access, and testing it for various different coverages like line and toggle coverage.
Introduction (Heading 1)
The implementation of this project involved three primary steps:
Designing an encoding for the SIK instruction set
Implementing a multi-cycle processor and slowed memory 
Testing the design for coverage and proper functionality
Implementing a variable-size cache with prefetch capabilities
